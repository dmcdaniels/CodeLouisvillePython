#CodeLouisvillePythonProject2020

For my Python project I will be attempting to configure the code so that I can search different websites for prices on groceries and have it return which store sells the items at a cheaper cost. I will have it return the cost of the item. I am going to try and get it to allow me to input multiple items and have it print a list on what items I should by a which store.
