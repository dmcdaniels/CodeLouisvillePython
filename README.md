#CodeLouisvillePythonProject2020

For my Python project I built a fake grocery store inventory. A user can access this inventory to shop for the food they need. At the end it will add  the total cost of the food together to give the user the total. 

When running the code you should get a prompt with instructions followed by it asking you what groceries you want. 
When the loop is finished it will print out your total. 

# 3 requirements
1. I use a master loop for the user the run to build their grocery list.
2. I built a dictionary to list a store's inventory. In a seperate file I import that store and use it to gather the data for the main part of my project.
3. I created 3 functions for my code.
